                    Lets take a look at the past: Island Party 2018.

                <p>My primary responsibility as the graphic designer in 2018 was to establish a direction for the social
                    media graphics package. Below are some samples of what we ended up choosing.</p>

                <p>For Island Party 2019, I was the Marketing Director / Lead Graphic Designer. We wanted the marketing
                    material to be eye-catching and we came up with two main focuses: revisiting the color shceme and
                    introduce motion graphics.</p>

                <p>A problem we had for Island Party 2016 and 2017 was that we lacked any photos from the event. To
                    solve
                    this in 2019, we organized a group of photographers to capture the event so we could continuously
                    create
                    an archive of event photos.<br><br>Below are some select shots taken by me from our preliminary
                    event —
                    Battle of the Bands — and Island
                    Party Music Festival 2019,</p>
